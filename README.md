Minecraft Minigame Loader 1.8
===========

Hey there, you've found one of the projects I've been doing for fun! Not much to see here yet as I'm still working on the more intricate parts of this system. This little past-time project I've taken up is here to help Java beginners figure out how to start using Spigot, and give them some utils that can make your life easier.

If I ever end up completing this project, I'll put a Maven import tutorial here so you can clone this repo for yourself, use the api and maybe get a head start on making your own minigames to show off!
